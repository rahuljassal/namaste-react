#### What is emmet ?

Emmet uses different abbreviations and short expressions depending on what's passed, and then dynamically converts the abbreviations into the full code. Emmet is mostly used for HTML, XML, and CSS, but it can also be used with programming languages.

#### The Difference Between a Framework and a Library ?

1. Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
2. A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
3. The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.

#### What is CDN , why do we use it ?

A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.
A CDN improves efficiency by introducing intermediary servers between the client and the website server. These CDN servers manage some of the client-server communications. They decrease web traffic to the web server, reduce bandwidth consumption, and improve the user experience of your applications.

#### Why react is known as react ?

React is aptly named because: It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage. It's built around components that "react" and update.

#### what is cross origin in script tag ?

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain. It defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.

#### diff between react and react dom ?

React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces and ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM

#### difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via cdn

In development mode, we can enable and utilize React developer tools, devtools profiler, debugging environment attached with source code. We can utilize various functionalities such as Hot Module Replacement, diagnostics so that development environment will help to debug code.

In production mode, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.

#### Difference between async and defer ?

Async allows your script to run as soon as it’s loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading. In most cases, async is the better option — but there are exceptions.
